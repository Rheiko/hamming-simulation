# How to use
- Firstly, you must input binary code as a data which will be transmitted into another computer in the first textbox.
- Click on "Compute Hamming Code"
- The program will then generate a code with a parity bit.
- After that, you can enter the code generated earlier but with a purposely made error(s) in the binary code.
- Click on "Execute Error Correction"
- The program will then check the error and try to find where exactly the incorrect bit is.
